# OpenAI and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Integration

## Overview

Welcome to the OpenAI and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech integration project! This project combines the power of OpenAI's language generation with Google's Text-to-Speech capabilities to create a dynamic and immersive experience.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure to follow these steps:

1. Run `composer install` to install the required dependencies.

2. Run `composer require google/cloud-text-to-speech` to add the necessary Google Cloud Text-to-Speech library to your project.

3. Download the JSON authentication file from Google Cloud Platform and place it in the root directory of your project.

4. Modify the file located at `/app/Controllers/OpenAiConfig.php` with your OpenAI API key.
